Transitive Closure of a Graph using DFS
Given a directed graph, find out if a vertex v is reachable from another vertex u for all vertex pairs (u, v) in the given graph. Here reachable mean that there is a path from vertex u to v. The reach-ability matrix is called transitive closure of a graph.

For example, consider below graph




Transitive closure of above graphs is
     1 1 1 1
     1 1 1 1
     1 1 1 1
     0 0 0 1
